COMMAND FILE POC - EXECUTION SUCCESSFUL
==========================================

Timestamp: $(date)
User: $(whoami)
Hostname: $(hostname)

This proves that .command files executed via "Open" action:
1. Bypass "Allow Running Scripts" requirement
2. Execute without explicit script permission
3. Novel technique using file type handlers

Method:
- Downloaded via "Get Contents of URL"
- Saved via "Save File"
- Opened via "Open" action (NOT "Run Shell Script")

This is a NOVEL bypass technique!
==========================================
EOF

# Make audible to confirm execution
say "Command file executed successfully"

exit 0
